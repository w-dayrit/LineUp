##Technologies Used
NodeJS
ExpressJS
MongoDB
AngularJS
Ionic
Heroku

##General Approach
First, I thought up an app idea. Then, I made my wireframes. I put together the back end with NodeJS and ExpressJS. I created models and seeded the database.

Since I wanted it to be a mobile app, I used Ionic to build the front end. I combined two nav frames and created the pages. Then, I made the functions to pull the data from the backend to show on the front end.

##Installation Instructions
